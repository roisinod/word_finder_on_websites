# word_finder_on_websites
#Personal project. I wanted to create a program that read the data of a webpage just by using an URL and the internet. Downloading pages to examine or use in projects had been causing a clutter of files on my desktop.
#This program can be used to find out how many times a words occurs on any webpage given to it. It reads and opens the web page online. 
#It does not require saving the webpage as a file to the user's device.
#The program counts the occurance of a given word in the website's data. It returns the len and prints out list of the word in a Pandas dataframe format.
